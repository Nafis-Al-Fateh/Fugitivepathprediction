# 🧭 Sylhet Fugitive Movement Prediction Framework

## 🔍 Overview
This Streamlit-based framework provides an **interactive visualization tool** designed to help law enforcement or researchers analyze and simulate **fugitive movement probabilities** across **Sylhet, Bangladesh**.

Users can click on any location on the map to:
- Generate **directional movement probabilities** (North, South, East, West)
- View a **heatmap** showing nearby areas with higher likelihood of fugitive presence
- Experiment with how movement dynamics could vary by location  

The project serves as a foundation for a **data-driven predictive policing tool** that can integrate real-world visibility data (CCTV coverage, terrain, road density, hideout zones, etc.) in future versions.

## ⚙️ Installation & Usage

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sylhet-fugitive-predictor.git
cd sylhet-fugitive-predictor
````

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies

Create a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

Then install packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## 🧠 Prediction Logic

### 🔹 Step 1: User selects a map point

When a user clicks on a map location, the app records:

* Latitude (`lat`)
* Longitude (`lon`)

### 🔹 Step 2: Probability generation

A **Dirichlet distribution** generates four probabilities representing fugitive movement likelihood in four directions — North, South, East, and West.

The Dirichlet distribution ensures all probabilities sum to one.

> 🧠 In a real implementation, these values could depend on:
>
> * Road networks and exit points
> * CCTV visibility and coverage
> * Historical fugitive paths
> * Time of day or police patrol intensity
> * Terrain type (urban, rural, forested)

### 🔹 Step 3: Heatmap simulation

A **heatmap** is generated by creating random nearby points (±0.01° lat/lon) with intensity values between 0.3–1.0.
This represents areas with higher or lower fugitive presence likelihood.

Later, this can be replaced by:

* **GIS-based heat intensity**, or
* **Machine learning predictions** from real data sources.

### 🔹 Step 4: Stable session state

All generated data (probabilities + heatmap points) are stored in Streamlit’s `session_state`, so they remain fixed until the user selects a new point.

## 🧮 Example Output

After selecting a location:

```
North: 0.42
South: 0.27
East:  0.20
West:  0.11
```

A red marker appears on the map, and a heatmap highlights probable nearby hiding zones.

Would you like me to **add a visual flowchart** (e.g., “click → probability generation → heatmap → visualization”) and generate the image file so you can embed it in the README?
